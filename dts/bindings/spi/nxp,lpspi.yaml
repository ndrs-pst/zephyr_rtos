  pcs-sck-delay:
    type: int
    description: |
      Delay in nanoseconds from the chip select assert to the first clock
      edge.
      If not set, the minimum supported delay is used.

  sck-pcs-delay:
    type: int
    description: |
      Delay in nanoseconds from the last clock edge to the chip select
      deassert.
      If not set, the minimum supported delay is used.

  transfer-delay:
    type: int
    description: |
      Delay in nanoseconds between last SCK edge of a transfer word and the
      first SCK edge of the next transfer word.
      If not set, the minimum supported delay is used.

  data-pin-config:
    type: string
    enum:
      - "sdi-in,sdo-out"
      - "sdi-in,sdi-out"
      - "sdo-in,sdo-out"
      - "sdo-in,sdi-out"
    default: "sdi-in,sdo-out"
    description: |
      Configures which pins (SDO and SDI) are used for input and output data
      during single bit transfers.

  tristate-output:
    type: boolean
    description:
      Configures whether or not the output data is tristated between accesses
      (when PCS is negated). If set, the output will be tristated when PCS is negated,
      otherwise the output line retains the last value when PCS is negated.

  rx-fifo-size:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Max number of words in the RX fifo on this instance of the LPSPI.

  tx-fifo-size:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Max number of words in the TX/Command fifo on this instance of the LPSPI.

  dma-source-data-size:
    type: int
    description: |
      Default source data width in bytes for DMA transfers.
      Specifies the size of each element transferred from source.
      Common values: 1 (byte), 2 (word), 4 (dword), 8 (qword)

  dma-dest-data-size:
    type: int
    description: |
      Default destination data width in bytes for DMA transfers.
      Specifies the size of each element transferred to destination.
      Common values: 1 (byte), 2 (word), 4 (dword), 8 (qword)

  dma-source-burst-length:
    type: int
    description: |
      Default source burst length in bytes for DMA transfers.
      Number of bytes transferred in a single burst from source.

  dma-dest-burst-length:
    type: int
    description: |
      Default destination burst length in bytes for DMA transfers.
      Number of bytes transferred in a single burst to destination.
